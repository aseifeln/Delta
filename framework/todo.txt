TODO:
	-enemy behaviour (scroller/asteroid)
		-target player or shoot randomly/in some pattern
		-add projectiles
		-add targets for enemey to shoot at (direction or at player)
	-boss behaviour & projectiles
	-implement start menu, game over menu, scoreboard
	-background movement (indicates mode)
	-set player movement/rotation based on mode (scroller/asteroid)
	-decide on game cues that trigger mode change (score or all enemies/asteroids/boss cleared)

low priority:
	- fonts, UI stuff
	- save scores from previous games
	- image/canvas buffering?
	- factor out transform? make x, y, rot variables on game object, or have GameObject extend Transform
	- figure out how to use REQUIREJS or something similar, for concatenating multiple js files into one.

Observed bugs:
	- single asteroid sometimes randomly disappears, before going offscreen

Possible bugs sources:
	-missing checks for undefined/null/valid type (instanceof)
